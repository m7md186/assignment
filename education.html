        <p>I started the elementary school in Abdullah bin Suhail. I stuided there for 4 years.<br>
        Then I spent the last 2 years in Al-Rabie bin Ziyad School. <br> Later on I stuided in Dar Al-Thakafa for both Middle and High-school<br>
    I graduated with a 98.6% score and it made me really happy. <br> Currently I study at University of Jeddah and I hope to graduate in a year.<br>

        <h2>Jeddah Hakathoon</h2>
        <p>
            A few months ago I worked with a group of my friends in the Jeddah's University Hakathon<br> We reached the Semi-Finals, but sadly we did not win.<br>
            We worked on a phone application that can take care of a tourist. <br> The app idea was that the tourist can use the app to book hotels, see near by events.<br>
            look for the nearest restaurants etc.

        <h2>To-do List Website</h2>        
        <p>A few weeks ago I worked on a simple to-do list<br> the idea was that you add some things you want to do and then when you finish them you delete them.</p>
